-   Name of the experiment: Myopic loss aversion: additive vs multilicative
-   Number of players allowed: Participants do the experiment alone.
    So it is not a group decision. the numebers of players that can do the
    experiment at the same time can be maxed at 20
-   Group is page? No There are 2 rounds for every participant: first the
    questionnaire, then he does the experiment in one of the eight
    groups/games. So he does only one. In which group the participants playes
    should be allocated random.
-   The code can be opensource.

hope it is clear
