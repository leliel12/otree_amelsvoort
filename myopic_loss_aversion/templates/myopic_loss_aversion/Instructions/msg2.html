<p>Thank you for joining this experiment. It consists of <strong>nine successive rounds</strong>. We want to know what risk you would take if <strong>you get 100.000 dollars to invest</strong>. You have to play all nine rounds to see what will come out of the risk you took. Every round you start with the <strong>100.000 dollars</strong>, <strong>plus or minus to return you got in previous rounds</strong>. <strong>Only once every three rounds</strong> you can decide which part of this amount (between 0 and 100 percent) <strong>you want to invest in a stock</strong> with a <strong>60% chance to lose 3% and a 40% chance to win 7%</strong>. This means that you choose what percentage to invest before the first round and then you are committed to this choice in round one, two and three. <strong>In between every round</strong> the computer decides if <strong>you belong to the group who won 7 % or who lost 3%</strong>. What this means as to how much return you got is also shown to you after three rounds. After nine rounds the return of your investments through the nine rounds is shown to you.</p>
<p>How the calculations work is shown in the next example:</p>
<p>You decide to <strong>invest 50%</strong>. Than <strong>round one, two and three</strong> start. <strong>After these three rounds</strong> the computer tells you that <strong>you only earned 418, 29 dollar on your initial 100.000</strong>,- <strong>How this happened?</strong> In the <strong>first round</strong> the computer put <strong>you in the group who won</strong>. Your return of this round can be calculated in the next manner: <strong>7% win on 50% of 100.000,- dollar is 3.500,- dollar</strong>. The money you didn&rsquo;t invest stays the same of course. So after the <strong>first round</strong> you will have <strong>103.500,- dollars.</strong> Than <strong>round two starts</strong> with this 103.500 dollars <strong>You can&rsquo;t change the amount you invest, 50 % again</strong>. The computer decides you lose 3 %. <strong>So you lose 3% on 50% of 103.500,- this is 1.552,50,- dollar</strong>. Than <strong>round three starts</strong> with 101.947,50 dollar. <strong>Again you have to invest 50%</strong> and the computer decides <strong>you are losing again</strong>. This time <strong>you&rsquo;re loss is 3% on 50% of 101.947,50 that&rsquo;s 1.529,21</strong>. This means, in this example, your capital grew from your initial 100.000,- dollar to 100.418,29 dollars and the computer told you this only after three rounds. With this knowledge you have to decide which percentage you will invest in rounds four, five and six and than again this procedure will repeat itself in the rounds seven, eight and nine.</p>
