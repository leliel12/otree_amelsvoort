<p>Thank you for joining this experiment. It consists of<strong> nine successive rounds</strong>. We want to know what risk you would take if <strong>you get 100.000 dollars to invest</strong>. You have to play all nine rounds to see what&nbsp; will come out of the risk you took. <strong>Every round you start with the 100.000 dollars, plus or minus to return you got in previous rounds</strong>. <strong>Once every three rounds</strong> you have to decide which part of this&nbsp; amount (between 0 and 100 percent) you want to invest in a stock <strong>with a 60% chance to lose 3% and&nbsp; a 40% chance to win 7%</strong>. This means that you choose what percentage to invest before the first&nbsp; round and then you are committed to this choice in round one, two and three. In between every round&nbsp; the computer decides if you belong to the group who won 7 % or who lost 3%. What this means as to&nbsp; how much return you got on your last investment is shown to you after each round. After nine rounds&nbsp; the return of your investments through the nine rounds is shown to you.</p>
<p>How the calculations work is shown in the next example:</p>
<p><strong>You decide to invest 50% for the first three rounds</strong>. You can&rsquo;t change the percentage in between. In the first round the computer <strong>puts you in the group who wins. Your return of this round can be calculated in the next manner: 7% win on 50% of 100.000,- dollar is 3.500,- dollar.</strong> The money you&nbsp; didn&rsquo;t invest stays the same of course. <strong>So after the first round you will have 103.500,- dollars. This is shown to you</strong>. <strong>Than round two starts with this 103.500 dollars</strong> Y<strong>ou can&rsquo;t change the amount you invest, 50 % again. The computer decides you lose 3 %. So you lose 3% on 50 % of 103.500,-this is 1.552,50 dollar</strong>. Again this is shown. Than round three starts with 101.947,50 dollar. Again you have to invest 50% and the computer decides you are losing again.<strong>This time your loss is 3% on 50 % of&nbsp; 101.947,50 dollar, that&rsquo;s 1.529,21 dollar</strong>. This means, in this example, <strong>your capital grew from your initial 100.000,- dollar to 100.418,29 dollars.</strong> With this knowledge you have to decide which percentage you will invest in <strong>rounds four, five and six</strong> and than again this procedure will repeat itself in the rounds <strong>seven, eight and nine.</strong></p>
