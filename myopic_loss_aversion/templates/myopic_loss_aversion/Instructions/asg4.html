<p>Thank you for joining this experiment. It consists of nine successive rounds. We want to know what risk you would take if, in every round, <strong>you have 10.000 dollars to invest</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You have to play all nine rounds</strong> to see what will come out of the risk you took. <strong>Every round you start again with another 10.000 dollars to invest</strong>. Every round you have to decide which part of this amount (between 0 and 100 percent) you want to invest in a stock with a <strong>60% chance to lose 3% and a 40% chance to win 7%</strong>. This means that you choose how much to invest <strong>before every round but only every three rounds it is told to you how much you earned with your investment</strong>. In between every round the computer decides if<strong> you belong to the group who won 7 % or who lost 3%</strong>. However these returns are only <strong>shown to you every three rounds</strong>. So after <strong>round three</strong> the total return of <strong>round one, two and three</strong> are shown to you.&nbsp; This results are then showed again to you after<strong> round six and after round nine.</strong> </p>
<p>How the return of a single round is calculated is shown in the next example:</p>
<p><strong>You decide to invest 50%</strong> and the computer puts <strong>you in the group who won</strong>. Your return of this round can be calculated in the next manner: <strong>7% win on 50% of 10.000,- dollar is 350 dollar</strong>. This is <strong>not</strong> shown to you. Than you <strong>decide which percentage you invest in round two</strong>. The computer <strong>puts you randomly in the win or lose group</strong> and then the third round starts. After you decided your percentage of investment the computer puts you in a win or lose group again and then,<strong> after three rounds, it becomes clear what you earned the first three rounds Than round four, five and six follow the same procedure.</strong></p>
