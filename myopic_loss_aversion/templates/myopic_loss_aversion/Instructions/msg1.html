<p>Thank you for joining this experiment.<strong> It consists of nine successive rounds</strong>. We want to know what risk you would take if <strong>you get 100.000 dollars to invest</strong>. You have to play all nine rounds to see what will come out of the risk you took. Every round you <strong>start</strong> with the <strong>100.000 dollars</strong>, <strong>plus</strong> or <strong>minus to return you got in previous rounds</strong>, to invest. And <strong>every time</strong> you have to decide which part of this amount (between 0 and 100 percent) you want to invest in a stock with a <strong>60% chance to lose 3% and a 40% chance to win 7%</strong>. In between <strong>every round the computer decides</strong> if you belong <strong>to the group who won 7 % or who lost 3%</strong>. What this means as to how much return you got on your last investment is shown to you. After nine rounds the return of your investments through the nine rounds is shown to you.</p>
<p>How the calculations work is shown in the next example:</p>
<p><strong>You decide to invest 50%</strong> and the <strong>computer puts you in the group who won</strong>. Your return of this round can be calculated in the next manner: <strong>7% win on 50% of 100.000,- dollar is 3500 dollar</strong>. The money you didn&rsquo;t invest stays the same of course. So <strong>after the first round</strong> you will have <strong>103.500,- dollars</strong>. After that<strong> you begin with the next round</strong> with this <strong>103.500 dollar</strong> and decide again which percentage of this amount you are going to invest.<strong> <br /></strong></p>
