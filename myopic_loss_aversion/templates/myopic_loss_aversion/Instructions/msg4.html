<p>Thank you for joining this experiment. It consists of <strong>nine successive rounds</strong>. We want to know what risk you would take if <strong>you get 100.000 dollars to invest</strong>. You have to play all nine rounds to see what will come out of the risk you took. Every round <strong>you start with the 100.000 dollars, plus or minus to return you got in previous rounds</strong>. And <strong>every time you have to decide</strong> which part of this amount (between 0 and 100 percent) <strong>you want to invest</strong> in a stock with a <strong>60% chance to lose 3% and a 40% chance to win 7%</strong>. The computer decides if y<strong>ou belong to the group who won 7 % or who lost 3%</strong>. However <strong>these returns are only shown to you every three rounds</strong>. So <strong>after round three</strong> <strong>the total return of round one, two and three is shown to you</strong>.&nbsp; This results are then<strong> showed again to</strong> <strong>you after</strong> round <strong>six</strong> and in round <strong>nine.</strong></p>
<p>How the calculations work is shown in the next example:</p>
<p><strong>You decide to invest 50% and the computer puts you in the group who won.</strong> Your return of this round can be calculated in the next manner: <strong>7% win on 50% of 100.000,- dollar is 3500 dollar</strong>. The money you didn&rsquo;t invest stays the same of course. So <strong>after the first round</strong> you will have <strong>103.500,- dollars</strong>. <strong>This is not shown to you but you can change the amount you want to invest in round two to something different, for example 60%. </strong>Next the computer decides that in the<strong> second round you lost 3% on 60% of 103.500,- which is 1.863,- dollar.</strong> This leaves you with <strong>101.637,- dollar</strong>.<strong> Again this is not shown to you but you are allowed to change your investment percentage to for example 40%</strong>. The computer decides that <strong>you belong in the group that lost</strong>. This time<strong> you lost 3% on 40% of 101.637 dollar which is 1.219,64</strong>. Your capital in the first three rounds therefore <strong>grew from the initial 100.000,- dollar to 100.417,36 dollar</strong>. Now, <strong>after round three, for the first time your&nbsp; result is shown to you</strong>. With this knowledge you have to decide which percentage you will invest in <strong>rounds four, five and six</strong> and then again this procedure will repeat itself in the <strong>rounds seven, eight and nine.</strong> </p>
