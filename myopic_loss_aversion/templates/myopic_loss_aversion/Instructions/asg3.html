<p>Thank you for joining this experiment. It consists of nine successive rounds. We want to know what risk you would take if, in every round, you have <strong>10.000 dollars</strong> to invest.</p>
<p>You have to play all nine rounds to see what will come out of the risk you took. Every round you start again with another 10.000 dollars to invest. <strong>Once every three rounds</strong> you have to decide which part of this amount (between 0 and 100 percent) you want to invest in a stock with a <strong>60% chance to lose 3% and a 40% chance to win 7%.</strong></p>
<p>This means that you choose how much to invest<strong> before the first round</strong> and then you are committed to this choice in round one, two and three. <strong>In between every round</strong> the computer decides if you belong to the group<strong> who won 7 % or who lost 3%</strong>. What this means as to how much return you got on your investments is shown to you after each round. After nine rounds the return of your investments through the nine rounds is added up and shown to you.</p>
<p>How the return of a single round is calculated is shown in the next example:</p>
<p><strong>You decide to invest 50%</strong> and the computer <strong>puts you in the group who won</strong>. Your return of this round can be calculated in the next manner:<strong> 7% win on 50% of 10.000,- dollar is 350 dollar</strong>. The money you didn&rsquo;t invest stays the same of course. <strong>So after the first round you will have 10.350,- dollars. The computer will tell you so.</strong> After that you begin with the next round.</p>
<p><strong>Than round two starts,</strong> you can&rsquo;t change the amount you invest, <strong>50 % again</strong>. The computer decides<strong> you lose&nbsp; 3 %.</strong> So you <strong>lose 3% of 5.000,- dollar is 150,- dollar</strong>. This is shown to you.</p>
<p><strong>Than round three starts</strong>, again you have to i<strong>nvest 50%</strong> and the computer decides you are losing again. <strong>Again that&rsquo;s 150,- dollar</strong>. <br /><strong>So after three rounds in this example you won 350,-dollar and lost two times 150,- dollar,&nbsp; in total you won 50,- dollar.&nbsp;</strong> And after round <strong>three</strong> you can decide which amount you will invest now for round <strong>four, five and six.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember, this is only an example! You could have won more or lost more!</strong></p>
